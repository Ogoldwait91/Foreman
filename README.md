# Foreman — Built for the trades.

Foreman helps tradespeople run jobs, get paid fast, and see their real take-home after VAT/tax — without the faff.

## Modules (MVP)
- Invoices: create/send, branded PDF, status tracking
- Payments: Open Banking links (low fee), reconcile by reference
- Balance: Yours vs VAT vs Tax, monthly roll-ups
- Records: job folders + monthly archives (invoices/receipts)

## Repo layout
