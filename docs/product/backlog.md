# Foreman — MVP Backlog

## Must-Have
- New Invoice flow (client → items → VAT → preview → send)
- Balance engine (Yours/VAT/Tax) — local calc
- PDF invoice (logo, header, line items, VAT breakdown, totals)
- Storage layout: /jobs/{jobId}/invoices/{invoiceId}.pdf etc.
- Settings (VAT rate, tax reserve %)

## Nice-to-Have (post-MVP)
- Quotes → convert to invoice
- Expense capture (photo receipt)
- Recurring invoices
- Late fee / auto reminders
- Accountant read-only access

## Tech Tasks
- Lints + format hooks
- Simple theming tokens file
- App icon & splash (Foreman F)
- Env handling for backend keys
